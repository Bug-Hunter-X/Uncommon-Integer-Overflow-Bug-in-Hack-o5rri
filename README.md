This repository demonstrates a subtle integer overflow bug in Hack. The bug occurs in a scenario with nested function calls where intermediate results exceed the maximum value of the integer type. The bug is uncommon because it is not immediately obvious from the code and requires an understanding of how integer overflow can happen during calculations in a series of function calls.  The solution involves adding checks for potential overflow conditions before performing arithmetic operations to prevent unexpected results.
